# 🚦 DV-RoadSafe Analytics

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis & Interactive Dashboard for Road Accidents  
**Internship Project | Infosys Springboard | September 2025**

---

## 📁 Project Overview

**DV-RoadSafe Analytics** is an internship project focused on analyzing a large-scale **road accident dataset** to uncover trends, patterns, and key factors influencing accident severity.  
The project combines **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and a **Streamlit-based interactive dashboard** to present insights in a visually compelling and user-friendly way.

The objective is to provide actionable insights to support **road safety policies**, **awareness campaigns**, and **data-driven decision-making**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform complete **EDA** on real-world accident data.  
- Analyze accident trends by **time, weather, location, and road conditions**.  
- Visualize data using Python libraries and build an **interactive dashboard** with **Streamlit**.  
- Present key insights for improving road safety measures.  
- Demonstrate end-to-end data analysis — from raw data to an interactive web app.

## 📍 Project Modules

1. **Dataset Acquisition & Exploration** – Load, inspect, and understand dataset structure.  
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, outliers, and format columns.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Create new features (e.g., hour, weekday, month).  
4. **Univariate Analysis** – Analyze distributions of severity, time, and weather conditions.  
5. **Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis** – Explore relationships between severity and multiple factors.  
6. **Geospatial Analysis** – Visualize hotspots and accident-prone areas on a map.  
7. **Insight Extraction & Hypothesis Testing** – Test assumptions and draw conclusions.  
8. **Visualization & Storytelling** – Generate charts and explain findings.  
9. **Streamlit Dashboard Development** – Build and deploy an interactive web dashboard to explore data.  
10. **Documentation & Presentation** – Compile all findings and insights into reports and presentations.

## 📈 Sample Insights

* 🚗 **Peak accident hours:** Morning and evening rush hours
* 🌧️ **Weather impact:** Accidents are more severe during **rain and fog**
* 👁️ **Visibility:** Low visibility strongly correlates with higher severity
* 🗺️ **Hotspots:** Certain cities consistently show higher accident density

---

## ✅ Outcomes

* Successfully built an end-to-end data analytics solution with **EDA and visualization**.
* Created a **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive exploration of accident data.
* Enhanced skills in **data analysis, data cleaning, visualization, and web app deployment**.
* Presented actionable insights to improve **road safety awareness** and **policy decisions**.
